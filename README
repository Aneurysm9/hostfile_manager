This is a simple Perl script for managing multiple hostfile configurations on *NIX systems.

To get started, create a directory /etc/hostfiles and place one or more files in the directory containing hostfile fragments.  The fragment filename will be used to tell the hostfile manager what to enable or disable.

Using the hostfile manager is simple.  It has two options: --enable and --disable.  You can specify each multiple times or pass comma-separated lists of fragment filenames.

For example, to enable a hostfile fragment called "staging":

hostfiles --enable staging
